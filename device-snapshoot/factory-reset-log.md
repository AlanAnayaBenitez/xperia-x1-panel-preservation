### Step 1: Welcome Screen ‚Äì Windows Mobile 6.1
- Language: Spanish (LatAm)
- No branding, no splash screen from carriers
- Displays prompt: ‚ÄúPuntee en la pantalla para configurar su dispositivo‚Äù
- Confirms Microsoft copyright
- Screen appears immediately after boot and reset

### Step 2: Touchscreen Calibration

After the welcome prompt, the device initiates touchscreen calibration using a moving crosshair. The user is instructed to tap the exact center of each cross as it moves across various screen positions. Calibration was performed using the original Xperia X1 stylus.

Captured targets demonstrate calibration at:
- Center of the screen
- Top corner region
- Bottom edge

All responses and positioning were accurate, confirming digitizer functionality post-reset.

### Step 3: Stylus Interaction Instructions

After completing touchscreen calibration, the device presents a tip screen titled **‚ÄúL√°piz‚Äù**, explaining the core usage of the stylus in Windows Mobile. The prompt reads:

> ‚ÄúPuntee en un elemento para seleccionarlo o mant√©ngalo presionado para ver un men√∫.‚Äù

A checklist below demonstrates sample actions users can perform, such as:
- Buying stamps
- Calling contacts
- Editing or deleting appointments

Two buttons appear at the bottom: **Omitir (Skip)** and **Siguiente (Next)**, allowing the user to move forward manually.

This screen confirms the OS is localized in Spanish and provides first-time interaction guidance with touch gestures.

### Step 4: Calendar Interaction Tutorial

The system guides the user through a stylus-based copy/paste operation within the calendar app. This touch tutorial demonstrates multitap behavior and gesture-based editing using the stylus.

Captured sequence:

- **calendar_01_view-entry.jpg**  
  A calendar entry titled ‚ÄúCita con el dentista‚Äù is shown in the 10:00 AM slot.

- **calendar_02_context-menu.jpg**  
  After holding the stylus over the event, a context menu appears with options including Cut, Copy, and Delete. The user selects ‚ÄúCortar‚Äù.

- **calendar_03-entry-pasted.jpg**  
  The user taps another time slot, holds briefly, and selects ‚ÄúPegar‚Äù to move the event. This confirms clipboard functionality and input responsiveness.

This sequence visually reinforces the stylus-first UI philosophy of Windows Mobile 6.1.

### Step 5: Date and Time Configuration

After the calendar interaction tutorial, the system displays the time and date configuration screen. Default values observed:

- **Timezone**: GMT -05:00 Bogot√°, Lima, Quito
- **Date**: May 15, 2009
- **Time**: Approximately 12:04 PM

These defaults align with the firmware's regional preset and may reflect the ROM compilation date or default system timestamp. Notably, the time zone and clock appear pre-filled without user input, and no network time sync occurs at this stage.
